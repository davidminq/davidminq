### About

I'm a front-end developer and former designer passionate about creating accessible, scalable, and emotionally resonant digital experiences.  
My work blends technical precision with visual clarity, driven by an understanding of how design and code shape user behavior and perception.

With a background in visual storytelling and user interface design, I focus on building interfaces that don't just function — they communicate.
